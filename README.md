This application is designed to help you quickly create a roster for a new team you are managing. The application is invoked by typing "node index" into the command line. Once begun, the app will ask you a list of questions beginning with manager input. After entering manager input, you are prompted to enter more team members based on their position: engineer or intern. You can add as many team members you'd like or you can decide to exit the application. After the questions are answered, an index.html is generated with all the user input into an organized roster displaying important information. The application also includes 4 test suites with a total of 17 tests. To run the tests, simply type "npm test" into the command line.
